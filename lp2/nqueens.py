# ðŸ”¹ N-Queens Problem â€“ Code Explanation in Points
# This code solves the N-Queens problem, which is to place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other (i.e., no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal).

# ðŸ”¸ Key Concepts & Functions
# printSolution(board, N)

# Prints a single board configuration (solution).

# 1 represents a queen, 0 means empty.

# isSafe(board, row, col, N)

# Checks if placing a queen at (row, col) is safe:

# No queen in the same row on the left.

# No queen in the upper left diagonal.

# No queen in the lower left diagonal.

# solveNQUtil(board, col, N, solutions)

# Recursive backtracking function.

# Tries placing queens column by column.

# If it reaches column N, a valid solution is found and added to solutions.

# Backtracks after exploring each possibility.

# solveNQ(N)

# Initializes board and solution list.

# Calls the recursive solver.

# Prints all solutions or states that none exist.

# ðŸ”¸ Output
# Prompts for N (number of queens).

# Prints all valid arrangements (if any).

# Also prints total number of solutions found.

# ðŸ”¸ Example (N = 4)
# Output:

# yaml
# Copy
# Edit
# Total solutions found: 2
# 0 0 1 0 
# 1 0 0 0 
# 0 0 0 1 
# 0 1 0 0 

# 0 1 0 0 
# 0 0 0 1 
# 1 0 0 0 
# 0 0 1 0 
# Each 1 indicates a queenâ€™s position.

# ðŸ”¸ Time Complexity
# Worst Case: O(N!) due to the nature of backtracking.

# Space: O(NÂ²) for board storage.

# Let me know if you'd like a diagram or dry run to visualize it better.
