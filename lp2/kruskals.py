# ðŸ”¹ Kruskal's Algorithm with Disjoint Set â€“ Theory in Points
# âœ… Disjoint Set (Union-Find) â€“ class DisjointSet
# Purpose:
# Efficiently tracks connected components of a graph to detect cycles.

# __init__(self, n):
# Initializes n elements, each in its own set (parent[i] = i).

# find(u):

# Returns the root of the set containing u.

# Uses path compression to flatten the structure, making future operations faster.

# union(u, v):

# Connects the sets containing u and v by linking their roots.

# Ensures no cycle is formed when building MST.

# âœ… Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm â€“ kruskal(graph_edges, num_vertices)
# Purpose:
# Finds a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) by choosing the lowest weight edges without forming cycles.

# Input:

# graph_edges: List of (weight, u, v) tuples.

# num_vertices: Total number of vertices in the graph.

# Steps:

# Sort all edges by increasing weight.

# Initialize a Disjoint Set to track connected components.

# For each edge:

# If u and v are in different sets (no cycle), include the edge in MST.

# Perform union(u, v) to merge the sets.

# Output:

# Returns a list of MST edges and the total minimum weight.
