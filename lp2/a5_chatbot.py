# This Python code simulates a simple interactive chatbot that engages the user in conversation and asks basic questions.

# ðŸ”¸ Function-wise Explanation
# greet(bot_name, birth_year)

# Introduces the chatbot using its name and creation year.

# remind_name()

# Asks the user for their name and compliments it.

# guess_age()

# Uses the Chinese Remainder Theorem to guess the user's age.

# Asks for the remainders when dividing the age by 3, 5, and 7.

# Formula:

# python
# Copy
# Edit
# age = (rem3 * 70 + rem5 * 21 + rem7 * 15) % 105
# count()

# Demonstrates counting ability by printing numbers from 0 to a user-specified value.

# test()

# A multiple-choice quiz asking: "Why do we use methods?"

# Loops until the correct answer (2) is entered.

# end()

# Displays a congratulatory message and ends the conversation.

# ðŸ”¸ Sample Output
# vbnet
# Copy
# Edit
# Hello! My name is TE-Chatbot.
# I was created in 2022.
# Please, remind me your name.
# > Yash
# What a great name you have, Yash!
# Let me guess your age...
# ...
# Your age is 21; that's a good time to start programming!
# ...
# Let's test your programming knowledge.
# Why do we use methods?
# ...
# 2
# Completed, have a nice day!
# ðŸ”¸ Features
# Covers input/output, loops, functions, conditionals, and basic logic.

# Great beginner-level Python project.
